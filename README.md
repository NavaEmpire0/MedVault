## üìñ About The Project

MedVault is a web application designed to solve the problem of managing and accessing personal health reports, especially in environments without advanced digital infrastructure. It allows patients to create a persistent digital profile, upload medical documents, and generate a unique QR code. This QR code can be scanned by any smartphone to display a secure, **view-only** version of their health dashboard, making it easy to share critical information with doctors quickly and efficiently.

### ‚ú® Core Features

* **Secure Patient Profiles:** Create a persistent health profile protected by a Patient ID and a PIN.
* **Editable Dashboard:** Log in to a full-featured dashboard to edit personal details, update medication lists, and manage your profile picture.
* **File Uploads:** Easily upload and store medical documents like blood tests, X-ray reports, and more.
* **Shareable QR Codes:** Generate a unique QR code that links to a password-less, read-only version of your dashboard, perfect for sharing with healthcare providers.
* **Interactive Medication Management:** Build and manage lists for "Currently Using Medicines" and "Medication History" with an easy-to-use interface.
* **Integrated Drug API:** Look up information on common medications directly within the app, powered by the openFDA API.
